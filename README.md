# Machine Translation Using Transformers

Here we build a machine translation model using Transformers. In particular we will perform English to German translation. We will use the Anki deu-eng language dataset from http://www.manythings.org/anki/ to train and test the model. This dataset consists of over 200,000 pairs of sentences in English and German. But we will work with only a subset of nearly 100,000 sentence pairs to reduce training time.
